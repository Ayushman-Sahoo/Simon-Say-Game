# Simon-Say-Game
A simple web-based memory game inspired by the classic "Simon Says." The game generates a random sequence of colored button flashes that the player must repeat in the correct order. With each level, the sequence gets longer, testing the player's memory and focus. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
